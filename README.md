Following the published [Human Interface Guidelines](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/573097), and [First Principles of Interaction Design](https://asktog.com/atc/principles-of-interaction-design/) liberally re-interpreted for today.


...* Because according to Edward Snowden, [Apple Just Declared War on Your Privacy](https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/p/all-seeing-i) (all the while talking about "privacy", "security", "trusted")


...* Because Apple has become Big Brother with considering [Client-Side Scanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07450), distrusting its users and treating them like potential criminals, searching through users' data


...* Because Apple thinks that ["Sideloading is a cyber criminal’s best friend"]( https://twitter.com/verge/status/1455983636830990337) - and wants to be the gatekeeper for everything that runs on _your_ device


...* Because App Stores allow governments to prevent certain applications from being used https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/12/russia-putin-google-apple-navalny/


...* Because we want "Personal Digital Sovereignty", in other words: be in full control over what our devices are doing


...* Because we want to run apps from "unidentified developers" that need no blessing by the operating system vendor and no workarounds like https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/textedit-gatekeeper.html (Note: Maybe `sudo spctl --master-disable` does the trick if you are root on the machine, which means no luck on "managed" devices)


...* [Gatekeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_(macOS)) ("It forced Mac developers, who had previously been legally free, to sign a strict contract."   [Source](https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1440735016611246086)) (Note: Maybe `sudo spctl --master-disable` does the trick if you are root on the machine, which means no luck on "managed" devices)


...* @antranigv on *macOS to FreeBSD migration a.k.a why I left macOS* https://antranigv.am/weblog_en/posts/macos_to_freebsd/


...Example: Install a kernel extension https://twitter.com/CastIrony/status/1444077820041318400 - probably the process doesn't even work on "managed" devices where some central IT department thinks it knows best which kexts the users "need". 

...* https://bombich.com/blog/2021/05/19/beyond-bootable-backups-adapting-recovery-strategies-evolving-platform (If the soldered-in SSD fails, you cannot boot from external bootable media, because "security")


...* Because we want all software to be "sideloaded" rather than coming from monopolistic stores https://www.lunduke.com/2021/07/google-goes-to-war-against-sideloading/
